# 2.5D-FPS-Walker
Just a toy code to implement a simple fps engine.

## Getting Started
Just run build_vs2017.bat from the root folder and then build directory will be created. After that open the FPSWalker project and build it using Visual Studio.

Make sure that you have CMake installed in your system. Also, the project works only on Windows-family systems, not Linux or Mac. You don't need to build or include any third-party libraries.

I use Visual Studio 2017 but VS2019 probably will be fine too.
